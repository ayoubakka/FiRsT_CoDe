SOCKET MODULE IN PYTHON:

The socket module in Python provides a low-level interface to network communication. 
It enables the creation of network sockets, which are endpoints for sending or receiving 
data over a network. Sockets can be used for various networking tasks, such as client-server 
communication, data transfer, and network protocol implementation.

The socket module supports both TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP 
(User Datagram Protocol) for communication. TCP provides a reliable, 
connection-oriented communication, while UDP offers a simpler, connectionless 
communication with less overhead.

Common operations with the socket module include creating a socket, 
binding it to a specific address and port, listening for incoming connections, 
and establishing connections. It's a fundamental tool for building networked applications 
in Python.

THREADING MODULE IN PYTHON:

The threading module in Python is a built-in module that provides a way to create and manage 
threads. Threads are lightweight, independent units of execution that allow a program to perform 
multiple tasks concurrently. In Python, the threading module is used for thread-related operations.

Threads in Python are particularly useful for concurrent programming, where different parts 
of a program can run independently.
